# EASY-FIA
EASY-FIA is a free software that has been created for researchers in the field of Flow Injection Analysis Mass Spectrometry (FIA-MS) for metabolomics data pre-processing.
The application retrieves the csv files of the samples and the relative blanks produced by any kind of high-resolution mass spectrometer, and performs blank subtraction, m/z alignment and identification based on the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB). 
EASY-FIA is a standalone MATLAB application which provides the user a GUI to set parameters for the elaboration and to keep track of the ongoing processes, therefore it does not require programming expertise. 
For further instructions on how to download and deploy the software, see the file "Tutorial_EASY-FIA".
